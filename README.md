Rap Song Generator

Designed and Created by Graham Vickers and James Pratt


Getting Started:
To use the Generator, you must first copy the Github repository link and clone it in a Terminal window. Once downloaded, open the 'Index.html' file in the browser of your choice. To get generating, first choose an instrument kit, then drag any icon from the bottom box into one of the empty grey boxes at the top. Repeat this until you have used all the icons, once you have done that your song is complete. If you want to make another song, select a different kit and generate a new one.

Built With:
- HTML5: used for sorting the information and general layout
- CSS3 - used for styling the website
- JavaScript: used for the icon drag-ability, as well as linking the audio to play on drop.
